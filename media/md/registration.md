Registration for all participants costs Â£75, including lunch and breaks. We do not want the the cost to be a barrier to participation so we are able to offer some free places for those who would not otherwise be able to attend, with a maximum of one place per institution.

The closing date for reservations is 4th January 2017.

If you are travelling to Durham the day before the conference please contact Event Durham <https://www.dur.ac.uk/event.durham/> for information on college accommodation or accommodation in the City.
