Registration for all participants costs Â£85, including lunches on Thursday and Friday and breaks. We do not want the the cost to be a barrier to participation so we are able to offer some free places for those who would not otherwise be able to attend, with a maximum of one place per institution.

The closing date for reservations is 4th January 2018.

Reservation for the conference will appear here.
