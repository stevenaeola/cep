Computer Science @ Durham is delighted to host this first conference in computing education practice.  While there are conferences based in the US and around Europe, there
is no regular UK-based event for HE computing education. CEP will provide
an opportunity to discuss with like-minded people the challenges and
opportunities that face us, and how these are changing.  As well as a
platform for presenting, exploring and sharing ideas and new
approaches there will also be opportunities for focused discussion on
the topics raised.  We are delighted that Sally Fincher, Professor of
Computing Education at Kent University, will give a keynote address to
get the day started and that Kay Hack, STEM lead from the HEA, will be starting the afternoon session.


Who is it for?
--------------

CEP is aimed at practitioners and researchers in computing education, both within Computing departments and elsewhere.  The conference provides a platform to share and discuss issues, and how they apply to computing education.

How will the conference run?
----------------------------

CEP aims to be a community, not a series of proceedings; everybody is encouraged to participate even if they are not presenting.  Throughout the day there will be presentation sessions, with discussion time at the end of each session.
