CEP is a forum for showcasing and sharing computing education practice. Accepted submissions will be published, provided the presenter registers for and attends the conference.


CEP submissions should allow us to:

* understand the reported practice,

CEP follows a double-blind review process. Submissions should be anonymous, without information that enables identifying the authors or their institutions. References to your own previous work should be in the third person.

Please use the ACM Proceedings Template, using [Word and LaTeX templates](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template). The submission format will be set by the publisher and announced later.

Submission is through EasyChair at <https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cep21>.

For any queries, please contact the [organisers](organisation.php).


# Review Process {#review-process}

Submissions will be double-blind reviewed by two members of the [programme committee](organisers.php#programme-committee). Each reviewer will grade the submission on how well it addresses the above questions. It is expected that each review will take about 30 minutes.

Based on the outcomes of these reviews, the programme committee will then decide which papers are accepted for the conference.
