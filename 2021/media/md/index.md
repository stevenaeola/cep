CEP 2021 is the fifth conference in computing education practice. CEP provides an opportunity to discuss with like-minded people the challenges and opportunities that face us, and how these are changing. As well as a platform for presenting, exploring and sharing ideas and new approaches there will also be opportunities for focused discussion on the topics raised.

Who is it for?

CEP is aimed at practitioners and researchers in computing education, both within Computing departments and elsewhere.  The conference provides a platform to share and discuss innovations and developments in the practice of computing education. 

How will the conference run?

CEP aims to be a community, not a series of proceedings; everybody is encouraged to participate even if they are not presenting.
