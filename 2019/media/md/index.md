Computer Science @ Durham is delighted to host this third conference in computing education practice.  CEP provides
an opportunity to discuss with like-minded people the challenges and
opportunities that face us, and how these are changing.  As well as a
platform for presenting, exploring and sharing ideas and new
approaches there will also be opportunities for focused discussion on
the topics raised. 


Who is it for?
--------------

CEP is aimed at practitioners and researchers in computing education, both within Computing departments and elsewhere.  The conference provides a platform to share and discuss innovations and developments in the practice of computing education. Accepted papers will be published in the [ACM digital library](https://dl.acm.org).

How will the conference run?
----------------------------

CEP aims to be a community, not a series of proceedings; everybody is encouraged to participate even if they are not presenting.  During the conference there will be presentation sessions, and a poster session, with discussion time at the end of each session plus wider opportunities for networking.

The conference will run on Wednesday 9th January 2019, with a research meeting on the previous afternoon, Tuesday 8th January.
