CEP is a forum for showcasing and sharing computing education practice. We expect to publish accepted submissions in the ACM Digital Library.

CEP submissions should allow us to:

* understand the reported practice,
* appreciate its strength and significance, and
* contain sufficient detail to permit questioning and reproduction.

Submissions should be no more than 4 pages. You should aim to have something in every category, but you do not have to use them in the order presented. A different organisation may make better sense for your submission. The descriptive text is not mandatory, but is there to motivate and stimulate your thinking.

## What is it?
A short description of the practice you're presenting

## Why are you doing it?

What happened before? What is it changing / replacing / improving? What gap is it filling?


## Where does it fit?

A short description of your _teaching context_. You may, for instance, include a description of intake, class size, curriculum sequence; anything that's necessary for others to understand your situation. How do things work at your institution?



## Does it work?

How do you know? Give some evidence of effectiveness in context.


## Who else has done this?

Where did you get the idea from? (If from published reports, please include references). How did you find out about it? Was it easy/hard to adopt? What did you change?



## What will you do next?

Will you vary this, or develop it further?



## Why are you telling us this?

What is interesting, or useful, about this to someone else?


# Review Process

Submissions will be made through easychair, and double blind reviewed by two members of the programme committee. Each reviewer will grade the submission on the following criteria:

* Does the paper adequately describe the sort of institution/classroom in which it is used?
* Could you implement this? Is there enough information? Is it the right information?
* Whether the evidence of effectiveness is compelling
* Whether this paper should be accepted for CEP 2019

It is expected that each review will take about 30 minutes.

Based on the outcomes of these reviews the programme committee will then decide which papers are accepted for the conference.
