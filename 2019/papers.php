The module aims to raise student awareness of current debates in computer science such as bias in artificial intelligence, algorithmic accountability, filter bubbles and data protection, and practical mechanisms for addressing these issues. To do this, the module includes interdisciplinary content from ethics, law and computer science, and also adopts some teaching methods from the law. I describe the format of the module, challenges with module design and approval, some initial comments on the first yearâ€™s cohort, and plans for future improvements. I believe that the topic is currently important and this discussion might be of interest to other computer science departments considering the introduction of similar content.",

Early and sustained collaboration helps students to strive beyond introductory programming towards professional software development. However, during their first year of study, students can find teamwork challenging. To equip learners with the foundational knowledge, skills, and experience that they need to collaborate effectively so early in their studies, a 3-day Robot Olympics using _Lego Mindstorms EV3_ robots can be deployed. The exercise draws upon Salas' big-five model of teamwork, making first-year students aware of coordinating mechanisms that aid in clarifying expectations and managing conflicts. These then act as lenses for reflection and feedback. Comparing a baseline cohort in 2015-16 to a cohort in 2016-17, after the introduction of the Robot Olympics, reveals a statistically significant reduction in team discord in an assessed collaborative programming project (d=0.76). This suggests that the Robot Olympics made a positive contribution to the design of the first computing module. Notably, helping students to enact and reflect upon their group work and related employability skills.",

The design of the assessment as part of this course is fundamentally based on Papert's work, and maintains a 'mathetic' approach, focusing on the process of learning rather than a transfer of knowledge and competencies. In order to do this, an online collaborative concept-mapping tool with history-tracking functionality is adopted.
The paper describes the social theory lens that informs the entire course and associated assessment design. The practical implementation of the course and how the assessment task functions as part of this learning design is explained, and finally some early evidence for the efficacy of the assessment is discussed.

        'abstract' => "In this paper, we consider an approach to supporting students of Computer Science as they embark upon their university studies. The transition to Computer Science can be challenging for students, and equally challenging for those teaching them. Issues that are unusual â€“ if not unique â€“ to teaching computing at this level include

* the wide variety in students background, varying from no prior experience to extensive development practice;
* the positives and negatives of dealing with self-taught hobbyists who may developed buggy mental models of the task in hand and are not aware of the problem;
* the challenge of getting students to engage with material that includes extensive practical element;
* the atypical profile of a computing cohort, with typically 80%+ male students. 

The variation in background includes the style of prior academic experience, with some students coming from traditional level 3 (i.e. A-levels), some through more vocational routes (e.g. B-Tech, though these have changed in recent years), through to those from experiential (work based) learning. Technical background varies from science, mathematical and computing experience, to no direct advanced technical or scientific experience.

A further issue is students' attainment and progression within higher education, where the success and outcomes in computer science has been identified as particularly problematic. Computer Science has one the worst records for retention (i.e. students leaving with no award, or a lower award than that originally applied for), and the second worst for attainment (i.e. achieving a good degree, that being defined as a first or a 2:1). 

One way to attempt to improve these outcomes is by identifying effective ways to improve student engagement. This can be through appropriate motivators â€“ though then the balance of extrinsic versus intrinsic motivation becomes critical.  In this paper, we consider how to utilize assessment â€“ combining the formative and summative aspects - as a substitute for coarser approaches based on attendance monitoring.

as male choose a STEM subject to study. This decreases in higher
education with 9% of females compared to 29% of males choosing a STEM
subject in 2017 [1]. To address this issue there are many initiatives
being set up to recruit females into STEM higher education
courses. However there is a lack of research into the experiences of
female students once they have started their degree programme in
Computer Science.  In this study we investigate the roles which
undergraduate female students choose in a large software engineering
team project to find out if there are barriers that prevent them from
taking on technical or programming roles in these projects. We
analysed assessment data to determine their previous programming
experience and then performed a content analysis of team project
deliverables and peer assessment scores. The results show that our
female students, despite their strong academic background, tend to
pick less technical roles in these projects than male students and are
subsequently awarded lower peer review scores by their teammates for
their contribution to the group work. These results indicate that
teaching interventions may need to take place to make the role choice
and peer review processes fairer in such projects. Further investigations are needed to see if there is some form of unconscious
bias or imposter syndrome occurring in our software engineering team
project module and if this is a common phenomenon in these projects in
other HE institutions.",

We explain how we plan to obtain some certainty on the value of interventions. Using an archive of data over the period, we find some interventions that should not be repeated. We also show that most changes introduced did not significantly improve students' learning, contrary to expectations. Instead, factors that were ignored had more influence on performance that factors we attempted to affect.",

Government to transform the digital skills profile of the country. In
the context of significant national and international education and

data that the country has a digital skills shortage across a variety
of sectors, yet the university system produces computing
graduates every year who end up unemployed, or underemployed. 
In this paper, we describe the background and evidence base for the
Institute of Coding, its key themes and current activities, as
well as reflecting on potential replicability of aspects of the
Institute to other nations or regions with similar ambitions.",
