CEP is a forum for showcasing and sharing computing education practice.
Accepted submissions will be published in the [ACM Digital Library](https://dl.acm.org/), provided the presenter registers for and attends the conference.

CEP submissions should allow us to:

* understand the reported practice,
* appreciate its strength and significance, and
* contain sufficient detail to permit questioning and reproduction.

* [Submission format and process](#submission-format-and-process)
* [Review process](#review-process)
* [Programme committee](#programme-committee)

# Submission content {#submission-content}

Submissions should be no more than 4 pages. You __MUST__ follow the CEP submission structure. The descriptive text is not mandatory, but is there to motivate and stimulate your thinking.

# Submission format and process {#submission-format-and-process}

All submissions must be in the ACM Proceedings Template to be accepted for publication in the ACM Digital library, using [Word and LaTeX templates](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template). Submitters MUST follow the CEP format detailed above.


Submission and  is through easychair at [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cep2020](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cep2020).


# Review Process {#review-process}

Submissions will be made through easychair, and double blind reviewed by two members of the programme committee. Each reviewer will grade the submission on the following criteria:

* Does the paper adequately describe the sort of institution/classroom in which it is used?
* Could you implement this? Is there enough information? Is it the right information?
* Whether the evidence of effectiveness is compelling
* Whether this paper should be accepted for CEP 2020

It is expected that each review will take about 30 minutes.

Based on the outcomes of these reviews the programme committee will then decide which papers are accepted for the conference.
